carstene1ns' dotfiles
=====================

Various configuration files used by me.

A lot of stuff is not included here yet, also screenshots will follow...

I use [GNU stow][1] to manage the individual files. It can generate symlinks to
the real, nested paths, while keeping everything organized in this repository
folder. A tutorial on how to use stow this way can be found [here][2].
